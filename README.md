# Brainfuck
 Brainfuck is a turing complete language with just 6 commands!
 That`s super cool, but also a problem - code is near impossible to write.
 This project exists to make brainfuck better.
# Stuff
- brainfuck(base interpreter is ready but there are few features)
  - a standart brainfuck compiler with some settings
- functional brainfuck(mwp interpreter is ready, std.fbf is not)
  - an extension of brainfuck that brings in function calls, labels and gotos, the stack and some qol features
  - a standart library, std.fbf is currently in development. it will bring a lot of qol functions for math, memory manipulation, io, etc
- objective brainfuck(just an idea)
  - a planned extension of functional brainfuck that will bring in OOP!
